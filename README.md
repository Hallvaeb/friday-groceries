Hunt statement: We are going to do look into young adults that are starting a new job by doing semi-structured interviews.

Young adults starting a new job means people that are planning to start a new job within 6 months, or have started the last year at a new job.

This github will be our repository for the whole project. Everyone is free to submit and create files and Hallvard is responsible for keeping an ok structure.
